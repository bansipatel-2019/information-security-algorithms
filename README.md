There are some Security Algorithms that are implemented in pyhton.
All the following algoriths are implemeted as a basic program rather tha having an advance versions.
This helps college students to understand and develop logic for the progam.
Programs Uploaded are
1. Vigenere Cipher
2. Hill Cipher
3. Columnar Cipher
4. Afine Cipher
5. Diffie Hellman Cipher
  -> There are two files in diffie hellman which are communicating over network for key exchange.
